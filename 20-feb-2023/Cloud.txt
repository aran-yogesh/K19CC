Cloud Computing:
-> Three types of cloud - Public, Private and Hybrid.
-> The cloud is a large group of interconnected computers. We usually use the symbol of cloud to denote the complicated 
networks in circuit.
-> Key properties of cloud computing:
1) User centric:
This means once a user is connected to cloud any data there, such as images, videos, applications, becomes his property.
2) Task centric:
CLoud computing focus on what one need an how application can do it for us. Here document are given more priority
than the applications which createthem.
3) Powerful:
Powerful in the sense that as there is large computers more computing power and mass data storage possible.
4) Self healing:
Because hot backups are available for every document in the cloud. Hence if one document crashes there will be duplicate ready to run.
5) Multi tenancy:
Refers to sharing data and costs across a large pool of users.
6) Programmable:
Many process in cloud computing shall be automate such as backing up crashed data with its duplicate.
7) FLexible:
As the users may be of different varieties and hance it has to match with their needs.

Benefits of cloud computing:

1) Reduces run time and response time:
As there is large computing capability run time and response time get reduced.
2) Minimize infrastructure ris:
Ad there is service providers to provide necessary infrastructure and services infrastructure risk get reduced.
we need not to purchase infrastructure.
3) Low cost entry:
For new organoztions the infrastructure and services can be rented and this reduces their cost of entry into the market.
4)Increased pace of innovation:
5) COst consious users are satisfied:

Cloud computing services:
1) Amazon web services.
2) Google App Engine.
