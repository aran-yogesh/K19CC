Replication object


You can replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multiple destination buckets
The destination buckets can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket

Why use replication
------------------

Replicate objects while retaining metadata
Replicate objects into different storage classes
Maintain object copies under different ownership
Keep objects stored over multiple AWS Regions 
replicate objects within 15 mins
sync bucket, replicate existing objects, and replicate previously failed or replicated objects
Replicate objects and fail over to a bucket in another AWS Region

When to use Cross-Region Replication
------------------------------------

S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different AWS Regions. CRR can help you do the following

Meet compliance requirements – Although Amazon S3 stores your data across multiple geographically distant Availability Zones by default, 
compliance requirements might dictate that you store data at even greater distances.

Minimize latency – If your customers are in two geographic locations, you can minimize latency in accessing objects by maintaining object
copies in AWS Regions that are geographically closer to your users.


replicating object policy 
--------------------------

"Action": [
                "s3:ReplicateObject",
                "s3:ReplicateDelete",
                "s3:ReplicateTags",
                "s3:ObjectOwnerOverrideToBucketOwner"
            ],



Steps to create a replicating object from source bucket to destination bucket 
====================================================================================

create source bucket and desitination bucket
ACl enabled
SSE key
bucket versioning enabled 

and open the source bucket and goto managemnet
goto replicating object and select destination file And save changes
